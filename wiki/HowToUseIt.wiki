= How To Use It =

After shopping around, we eventually decided to use [http://code.google.com Google Code] for our project hosting. We could have hosted it internally, pushing static snapshots of the project to a webserver somewhere. We could have gone with with !ColdFusion specific project hosting solutions, like http://riaforge.org/. Ultimately, Google Code's project management tools best suited our needs.

Here are the basic steps for using cf-password-generator:

  # Proceed to the [http://code.google.com/p/cf-password-generator/source/checkout Source tab] for our project page. Follow the directions for checking out the trunk of the project using Subversion.
    * `svn checkout http://cf-password-generator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cf-password-generator-read-only`
  # Copy or move the directory to your !ColdFusion webroot. At L&S we use [http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/ Adobe ColdFusion 9] on our development and production servers. You can also use [http://www.getrailo.org/ Railo] or [http://www.openbluedragon.org/ Open BlueDragon] with [http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/ Jetty] or [http://tomcat.apache.org/ Apache Tomcat].
    * cf-password-generator works on Adobe !ColdFusion 9 and Railo 3.2.
    * There is [http://code.google.com/p/cf-password-generator/issues/detail?id=4 a known issue with Open BlueDragon 1.4]. We are working to fix that.
